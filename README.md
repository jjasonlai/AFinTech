AFinTech is a platform that facilitates seamless access to financial services for borrowers. Committed to its mission of empowering customers, MoneFi offers essential resources and educational tools to significantly enhance businesses’ prospects.

Below are the areas that I have worked on:
● Developed UI components for the Administrator Dashboard, incorporating tables, charts, and information blocks. Effectively utilized react libraries such as React-Bootstrap, React-Select, Material UI, React-Tooltip, and Google-Map to develop functional components.
● Integrated UI components to monitor platform-wide data, including lenders, borrowers, users, and loan applications.
● Built back-end architecture for Administrator Dashboard by extracting multiple data sets with a single SQL procedure utilizing FOR JSON AUTO and de-serializing the data in the .NET environment.
● Developed efficient SQL stored procedures for optimized performance and accurate data retrieval based on specific criteria. Implemented stored procedures and a single-page application with REST API for advanced filtering and streamlined request routing to multiple data points with User Define Table Type.
